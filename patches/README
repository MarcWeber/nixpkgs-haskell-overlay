This directory contains patches making hackage packages compile.

Two kinds of patches are most common:
a) Patching constraints. Eg replace base < 4.0 by base < 4.current

b) add additional header and lib locations so that C libraries are found by
cabal and the compiler.

This directory is also read by hack-nix when generating the hackage db file for
nix.

The patches are named by the full package name. Example: bytestring-3.0.patch
