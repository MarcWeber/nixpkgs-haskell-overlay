haskell-nix-overlay
===================

status: experimental

GOAL
====
make all hackage packages availible to the nix repository manager (-> http://nixos.org).
Why have a separate package ? Writing the hackage index into a file which is readable by nix
results in a > 500kb file. Generating this file takes some time because all
source files are downloaded once in order to calculate hashes required by fetchurl.

Tracking many revisions of this file in nixpkgs can
have an impact on users tracking nixpkgs using git. So it would have been
enough to track everything but the hackage contents. However generating this
file takes quite some time that's why I do include it.

HOWTO
=====

a) optional: update hack-nix-db.nix file
  Get and compile hack-nix. (http://github.com/MarcWeber/hack-nix)
  # create the configuration file
  hack-nix --write-config

  # make target-file point to $THIS_REPO/hackage/hack-nix-db.nix
  $EDITOR .hack-nix

  # prepare a cup of tea
  Run hack-nix without any arguments.
  All sources will be fetched to calculate hashes so get ready to take a cup of tea!

b) compile example package:
  nix-build -A haskellOverlayPackagesExample.HAppS-Server

TODO
====
* tidy up code. Optimise for speed
* think about how packages defined in here can be reused in nixpgks
* maybe create nix channel (rename overlay to channel)
